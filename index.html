    <h1 id="story00">Introduction to Anthropology</h1>
    <p id="la">To begin with the etymology of the term, the term anthropology is a compound of two 
      Greek words, <i>‘anthropos’</i> and ‘logos’, which can be translated as ‘human being/mankind’ 
      and ‘reason/study/science’, respectively. So, anthropology means ‘reason about humans’ or 
      ‘the study or science of humankind or humanity’. Moreover, man has two important 
      characteristics: biological and cultural: It is very important to understand that the biological 
      and the cultural characteristics are inseparable elements.<br> Culture influences human physical 
      structures and the vise-versa. 
      Hence, if we take it literally, it is the study of humans. In one sense, this is an accurate 
      description to the extent that anthropology raises a wide variety of questions about the 
      human condition. Yet this literal definition is not particularly illuminating; because a number 
      of other academic disciplines—including sociology, biology, psychology, political science, 
      economics, and history—also study human beings. <br>What is it that distinguishes 
      anthropology from all of these other disciplines? Anthropology is the study of people—their 
      origins, their development, and contemporary variations, wherever and whenever they 
      have been found. It is a broad scientific discipline dedicated to the comparative study of 
      humans as a group, from its first appearance on earth to its present stage of development.  
      Of all the disciplines that study humans, anthropology is by far the broadest in scope.
