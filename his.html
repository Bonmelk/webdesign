    <h1 id="story00">History of Anthropology</h1>
    <p id="la">
      Like the other social sciences, anthropology is a fairly recent discipline. It was given its 
      present shape during the twentieth century, but it has important forerunners in the 
      historiography, geography, travel writing, philosophy and jurisprudence of earlier times.<br> 
      There are, in any case, many ways of writing the history of anthropology, just as, in any 
      given society, there may exist competing versions of national history or origin myths, 
      promoted by groups or individuals with diverging interests. History is not primarily a 
      product of the past itself, but is rather shaped by the concerns of the present. As these 
      concerns change, past events and persons shift between foreground and background, and 
      will be understood and evaluated in new ways.<br> 
      If we restrict ourselves to anthropology as a scientific discipline, some would trace its roots 
      back to the European Enlightenment, during the eighteenth century; others would claim that anthropology did not arise as a science until the 1850s, yet others would argue that 
      anthropological research in its present-day sense only commenced after the First World 
      War. Nor can we avoid such ambiguities. <br>      
      It is beyond doubt, however, that anthropology, considered as the science of humanity, 
      originated in the region we commonly but inaccurately call ‘the West’, notably in three or 
      four ‘Western’ countries: France, Great Britain, the USA and, until the Second World War, 
      Germany(Erikson, 2001). Historically speaking, this is a European discipline, and its 
      practitioners, like those of all European sciences, occasionally like to trace its roots back to 
      the ancient Greeks. </p>
