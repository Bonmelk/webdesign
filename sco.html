    <p id="la">The breadth and depth of anthropology is immense.  There no time and space left as far as 
    man exists. In other words, the temporal dimension covers the past, the present and even 
    the future. In terms of the spatial dimension, anthropology studies from Arctic to Desert, 
    from Megapolis to hunting gathering areas.<br><br>
     The discipline covers all aspects of human ways 
    of life experiences and existence, as humans live in a social group.  
    It touches all aspect of human conditions as far as there is a relation between human beings 
    and natural environment and man and man. Anthropology not only tries to account for the 
    social and cultural variation in the world, but a crucial part of the anthropological project 
    also consists in conceptualizing and understanding similarities between social systems and 
    human relationships. <br><br>
    As one of the foremost anthropologists of the twentieth century, 
    Claude Lévi-Strauss, has expressed it: ‘Anthropology has humanity as its object of research, 
    but unlike the other human sciences, it tries to grasp its object through its most diverse 
    manifestations’ (1983, p. 49). In other words, anthropology studies humanity with its all aspects of existence, and in its all means of differences (diversity) and similarities 
    (commonality). Where every human beinglives, there is always anthropology. 
    The discipline is also accounting for the interrelationships between different aspects of 
    human existence, and usually anthropologists investigate these interrelationships taking as 
    their point of departure a detailed study of local life in a particular society or a delineated 
    social environment. One may therefore say that anthropology asks large questions, while at 
    the same time it draws its most important insights from small places.<br><br> Although 
    anthropologists have wide-ranging and frequently highly specialized interests, they all share 
    a common concern in trying to understand both connections within societies and 
    connections between societies.  
    Such focus areas of investigation and the stated aims of the discipline convey that, the areas 
    covered by anthropology is diverse and enormous. Anthropologists strive for an 
    understanding of the biological and cultural origins and evolutionary development of the 
    species. They are concerned with all humans, both past and present, as well as their 
    behavior patterns, thought systems, and material possessions. In short, anthropology aims 
    to describe, in the broadest sense, what it means to be human (Peacock, 1986).</p>
